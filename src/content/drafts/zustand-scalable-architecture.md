After spending the past few months building out our app's state management with Zustand, I wanted to share some thoughts on how our approach has evolved and what we've learned along the way.

## The Early Days: Simple Store Files

When we first started, our Zustand setup was pretty straightforward. We had separate store files for different features - assets.tsx, links.tsx, qr-codes.tsx, etc. Each store was isolated and looked something like this:

```typescript
const useAssetStore = create<AssetStore>()((set) => ({
  assets: [],
  setAssets: (assets) => set({ assets }),
}));
```

This worked fine initially. The stores were easy to understand, and since each feature was relatively self-contained, there wasn't much need for complex interactions between them.

## Growing Pains

As our app grew, we started noticing some issues with this approach:

- Duplication: Similar patterns kept popping up across stores
- Tight Coupling: Some features needed to know about each other's state
- Scalability Concerns: Each new feature meant another isolated store file
- Testing Headaches: Individual stores were harder to test comprehensively

## The New Architecture: Slices and Related Elements

Our new approach takes inspiration from Redux Toolkit's slice pattern, but with Zustand's simplicity. Instead of isolated stores, we're organizing our state into interconnected slices with clear boundaries.
Here's what that looks like:

```typescript
// userSlice.ts
const createUserSlice = (set, get) => ({
  user: null,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
  // Related actions that affect other slices
  updateProfile: async (data) => {
    const theme = get().theme;
    // Update user and related state...
  },
});

// Combine slices in the main store
const useStore = create((set, get) => ({
  ...createUserSlice(set, get),
  ...createThemeSlice(set, get),
  ...createLinksSlice(set, get),
}));
```

## Why This Works Better

The new system has several advantages:

- Better Organization: Related state and actions live together
- Easier Testing: Slices can be tested in isolation
- Clear Dependencies: Inter-slice relationships are explicit
- More Maintainable: Changes are localized to specific slices
- Better TypeScript Support: Types are easier to manage

## Lessons Learned

The biggest takeaway? Start simple, but plan for complexity. Our initial approach wasn't wrong - it was appropriate for our needs at the time. But as applications grow, state management needs to evolve with them.
Some specific recommendations:

- Think about state relationships early
- Document dependencies between different parts of your state
- Use TypeScript to catch issues early
- Consider testing needs from the start

## What's Next

We're still refining this approach. Some areas we're exploring:

- Better dev tools integration
- More robust middleware support
- Improved persistence strategies
- Better performance optimizations

## Closing Thoughts

State management is never one-size-fits-all. What works for a small app might not scale to a larger one. Don't be afraid to evolve your approach as your needs change. The key is finding the right balance between simplicity and scalability for your specific use case.
